# MNIST_CNN_tf_low_level
implementation of tensorflow in CNN for digit classification

This is a thorough walk through on building CNN network by tensorflow at low level. 

I'm interested in visualization of weights in CNN and wrote some code to check on the weights. 

First 2 convolutionary layers show a clear visualization of weights. However, the final fully connected layers weights are fuzzy and hard to interpret.
